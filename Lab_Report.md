	Title:         Pokedex using PokeAPI
	
	Abstract:      In this program it is supposed to be able to call on accurate data from an API called PokeAPI to then display said data for the user in a readable and concise way. This is to make finsing a certain pokemon easier with it's basic stats for anyone using the program. 
	
	Introduction:  In a previous semester I had built this program in another language and wanted to build it to roughly the same function as I had in C# but in Java instead this time to test my abilities.
	
	Results:       The program works as intended and works well. It calls full lists of pokemon based on type or can call a pokemons basic stats and it types based on id number or name.
	
	Conclusion:    In conclusion the project was a huge success, it just took a while to finish and get it properly working.
